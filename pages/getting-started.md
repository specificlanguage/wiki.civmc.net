# Getting Started
## What is CivMC?
### Civilization Building
CivMC's main focus is the simulation of civilization, it's in the name after all. Mechanics unique to the server like  protecting blocks individually by reinforcing them with resources. Gives buildings, cities and whole nations a layer of control and protection. Both of which are not infallible unlike other genre's such as Factions, or Towny. This is in conjunction with another unique feature of imprisoning other players through combat, allows nations to enforce their laws and will on others through force when other means fail.  

### Community
The most important thing on CivMC is community, It makes you more resistant against villains looking to do you harm. But combat is not the only place community comes in handy. Forming friends and connections in the right places will allow you to influence the course of events in your country, or even on the world stage of international politics.

### Economy
CivMC has a very strange economy centered mostly around the production and selling of XP. This is because experience can only be gained through farming a wide variety of crops, that all require specific biomes and take much longer to grow than normal. These crops then get put through an expensive "Factory" which produces the XP in the form of emeralds. The emeralds can be consumed to gain xp directly or be crafted into bottles of enchanting. Allowing players to only make enchanted tools/armor after this labour intensive has been done. This also means only communities/nations are capable of real XP/enchanted item production. <br> A shop chest plugin allows players to sell anything for anything without being personally there to perform the trade, although at the risk of having your trade goods stolen by raiders. 

### Politics
Because of CivMC's focus on civilization building, real, impactful and player driven politics are derived and decide the course of the server. Countries completely organized and controlled by players negotiate with each other in diplomacy. They create Alliances, organize events and parties all without the help or intervention of admins. This is why people might call CivMC a Semi-Anarchy server, because of the freedom provided while still disallowing hacks or bigotry. This also means wars are the results of diplomacy breaking down, countries with ambitions or chaotic characters looking to sow chaos.

### War
War like the real world can take a long while. Wars on CivMC in some cases have lasted months, during which battles are fought, plans are executed, people are imprisoned and a lot of hours are lost preparing for these events. This happens either by crafting armor, weapons, and potions, or the creation of military infrastructure such as bunkers, underground ice roads and the ultimate defensive structures known as Vaults, where imprisoned players are kept, as well as usually a nations wealth if it's not drop chested. These structures consist of giant obsidian structures spanning chunks dug down to bedrock. And take an extraordinary amount of effort to make. 

### Fun
While CivMC can be quite the grind sometimes, there are also many things to do that are less intensive. Besides building nice things of course. You can become a simple merchant and sell your goods in shops around the word. Or delve into brewery and discover new drinks,foods and drugs with their unique effects. Maybe you're a fighter looking for the thrill of battle, lending out your sword to nation states or take a more risky route of raiding.  Or perhaps you'd simply enjoy a nice group of friends to play minecraft with. This and many things are possible when you're free on CivMC.
